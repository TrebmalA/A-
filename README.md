# A-
C# Scripts that were used to create a visualization of the A* algorithm, including a customizable map and maze and the ability to display heuristics on screen as well as increase and decrease the speed at which the animation of the algorithm plays at.

This was done for a school project to demonstrate the power of the A* algorithm for pathfinding.
These three files could be condensed into one, or separated further for better clarity based on function.
Essentially the MapGenerator does the bulk of the work for the algorithm itself as well as creating a map
or maze for the algorithm to navigate through. I will admit the A* algorithm itself has a slight flaw that
can be seen in the YouTube video I created to demonstrate the project, at the 3:27 mark. (Basically the 
algorithm will choose a diagonal tile to get closer to the end goal for one step, then another diagonal tile
when in reality it would be quicker to take a horizontal for two steps)
